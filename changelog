kladmin (0.2.1)

  * Replaced the genDetIds subroutine with a more robust
    version written by Nils-Anders Nøttseter. Summary:
    - Sorting of existing IDs are now done as integers, 
      not as strings (42 would sort after 2000).
    - Just loop over the smaller list of existing IDs,
      thus avoiding the previous double loop.
    - Prevents failure to give a proper ID if there were 
      no users in LDAP.

  * Created a new subroutine, genDetExe, to verify the 
    existence of all necessary executables. It is always 
    called at the beginning of each operation to prevent
    any failures from occurring half way through.

  * Added more code to check that routines associated
    with OpenLDAP and/or OpenAFS are not run when they 
    are not required.

  * Added the option IDMAX to kladmin.conf, to 
    optionally determine the maximum ID values for AFS 
    accounts and LDAP accounts and groups.

  * Added a few checks to make sure that the values for
    the options OPENLDAP, OPENAFS and IDMAX remain 
    consistent and do not exceed reasonable bounds.

  * ID number checking now takes place before accounts 
    are created, as opposed to during the operation, to
    prevent erroring out half way through.

  * Following Nils-Anders' example, modified two other
    sorting routines to treat ID numbers as integers.

  * Modified the README file to reflect the addition of
    the IDMAX option to kladmin.conf.

kladmin (0.2)

  * Made support for both OpenLDAP and OpenAFS optional
    through the addition of two extra options to the 
    kladmin.conf configuration file. However, the use
    of MIT Kerberos V is still obligatory.
    - Altered the documentation to reflect the above.
    - Thanks to Nils-Anders Nøttseter.
    
  * Changed the default for the AFS maximum volume quota 
    in the kladmin.conf configuration file (AFSQUO) from 
    1048576 KB to 0 KB (unlimited).

kladmin (0.1.2)

  * Bugfix to prevent kladmin from running two routines 
    to create and release read-only volumes when none 
    are indicated.
    
  * Minor edits to kladmin.conf.

kladmin (0.1.1)

  * Applied code improvements suggested by Davor Ocelic:
    - No more embedding of full path in command names;
      path or env. variables now followed instead.
    - simplified printing of options list.
    - Used single statements for the import of variables
      into the lower-level subroutines.
