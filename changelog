kladmin (0.2)

  * Made support for both OpenLDAP and OpenAFS optional
    through the addition of two extra options to the 
    kladmin.conf configuration file. However, the use
    of MIT Kerberos V is still obligatory.
    - Altered the documentation to reflect the above.
    - Thanks to Nils-Anders NÃ¸ttseter.
    
  * Changed the default for the AFS maximum volume quota 
    in the kladmin.conf configuration file (AFSQUO) from 
    1048576 KB to 0 KB (unlimited).

kladmin (0.1.1)

  * Applied code improvements suggested by Davor Ocelic:
    - No more embedding of full path in command names;
      path or env. variables now followed instead.
    - simplified printing of options list.
    - Used single statements for the import of variables
      into the lower-level subroutines.
